Important mismatch between the FastAPI client implementation and the original schema design.

## Changes Not Accounted for in Original Brief

### 1. Multiple HTTP Methods per Endpoint
- **Original assumption**: One method per endpoint
- **Reality**: FastAPI routes can accept multiple HTTP methods
- **Solution**: Generate separate client methods with HTTP verb prefixes (e.g., `get__list_users`, `post__list_users`)

### 2. Multiple Tags per Route
- **Original assumption**: Single tag per route (`route_tag: Safe_Str__Fast_API__Route__Tag`)
- **Reality**: FastAPI supports multiple tags per route for organization/documentation
- **Solution**: Change to `route_tags: List[Safe_Str__Fast_API__Route__Tag]`
- **Impact areas**:
  - Route extraction needs to capture all tags from FastAPI
  - Contract extraction might need to handle tag-based organization differently
  - Client generation may need to consider how to organize methods when routes have multiple tags

### 3. Cascading Effects
The tags change will likely affect:
- `Fast_API__Route__Extractor._create_api_route()` - needs to extract all tags, not just first
- Any code that assumes a single tag for grouping/organization
- The module organization logic that might use tags for categorization
